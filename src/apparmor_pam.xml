   <title>Confining users with <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem>
   </title>
   <info/>
   <para>An AppArmor profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as a subprofile. The <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> PAM module allows applications to confine authenticated users into subprofiles based on group names, user names, or a default profile. To accomplish this, <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> needs to be registered as a PAM session module.</para>
   <para>The package <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> is not installed by default, you can install it using YaST or <command>zypper</command>. Details about how to set up and configure <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> can be found in <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/pam_apparmor/README</filename> after the package has been installed. For details on PAM, refer to <xref linkend="cha-pam"/>.</para>
