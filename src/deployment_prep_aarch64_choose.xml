      <para>
         <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase> is normally installed as an independent operating system. With virtualization it is also possible to run multiple instances of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on the same hardware. The installation of the VM Host Server is performed like a typical installation with some additional packages. The installation of virtual guests is described in <phrase xmlns:l="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook/l10n" role="document-xref">Book <quote>Virtualization Guide</quote>, </phrase>

      <para>Most installations are to a local hard disk. Therefore, it is necessary for the hard disk controllers to be available to the installation system. If a special controller (like a RAID controller) needs an extra kernel module, provide a kernel module update disk to the installation system.</para>
      <para>Other installation targets may be various types of block devices that provide sufficient disk space and speed to run an operating system. This includes network block devices like <systemitem>iSCSI</systemitem> or <systemitem>SAN</systemitem>. It is also possible to install on network file systems that offer the standard Unix permissions. However, it may be problematic to boot these, because they must be supported by the <systemitem>initramfs</systemitem> before the actual system can start. Such installations can be useful when you need to start the same system in different locations or you plan to use virtualization features like domain migration.</para>
