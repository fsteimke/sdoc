   <para>The SUSE® Linux Enterprise Micro operating system can be deployed on a wide range of hardware. It is impossible to list all the different combinations of hardware SUSE Linux Enterprise Server supports. However, to provide you with a guide to help you during the planning phase, the minimum requirements are presented here.</para>
   <para>If you want to be sure that a given computer configuration will work, find out which platforms have been certified by SUSE. Find a list at <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/yessearch/"/>.</para>
   <!-- FSt: added 2nd sentence with xref, commented out variablelist -->
   <para>The Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures support the simple migration of x86 software to 64 bits. Like the x86 architecture, they constitute a value-for-money alternative. See <xref linkend="vl-x86-sysreqs-hw" xrefstyle="%label"/> for Hardware Reqirements.</para>

     The maximum number of CPUs supported by software design is 8192 for
     &intel64; and &amd64;. If you plan to use such a large system, verify with
     our hardware system certification Web page for supported devices, see

   <term>Memory requirements</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     &slema; requires at least 1GB RAM. Bear in mind that this is a minimal
     value for the operating system, the actual memory size depends on the
     workload.

    <para>
     The minimum hard disk space is 12GB. But the recommended value is 20GB of
     hard disk space. Adjust the value according to workloads of your
     containers.
