      <title>Considerations for deployment of <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase>
      </title>
      <para>The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT environment or as a completely new rollout must be carefully prepared. At the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each project, but the questions to answer should include the following:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
         <listitem>
            <para>How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best deployment methods differ.</para>

      <para>To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search form for certified hardware at <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.</para>
      <para>Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use installation servers or even completely automatic installations. When using Xen or KVM virtualization technologies, network root file systems or network storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.</para>
      <para><phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase> provides you with a broad variety of services. Most of the needed configurations can be made with YaST, the SUSE configuration utility. In addition, many manual configurations are described in the corresponding chapters.</para>
      <para>In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training the end users of the systems and help desk staff.</para>

         <title>Terminology</title>
         <para>In the following sections, the system to hold your new <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase> installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This includes physical media, such as CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, and network servers distributing the installation data in your network.</para>

      <title>Running <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase>
      </title>
      <para>The <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase> operating system is a well-tested and stable system. Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for downtime or data loss. Make sure that you have a backup solution in place for mission-critical tasks.</para>
      <para>For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run a second identical (pre-production) machine that you can use to test all changes. This also gives you the possibility of switching machines in case of hardware failure.</para>

   <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-registering">
      <title>Registering <phrase role="productname">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase>
      </title>
      <para>To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and activate your SUSE product with the SUSE Customer Center. We recommend to register during the installation, since this will enable you to install the system with the latest updates and patches available. However, if you are offline or want to skip the registration step, you can complete registration from the running system.</para>
      <para>In case your organization does not provide a local registration server, registering SUSE Linux Enterprise requires a SUSE Customer Center account. In case you do not have one yet, go to the SUSE Customer Center home page (<link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>) to create one.</para>
      <para>During the installation you will be asked to enter your registration code. For details, see <xref linkend="sec-yast-install-scc-registration"/>.</para>
      <para>If you deploy your instances automatically using AutoYaST, you can register the system during the installation by providing the respective information in the AutoYaST control file. For details, see <phrase xmlns:l="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook/l10n" role="document-xref">Book <quote>AutoYaST Guide</quote>, </phrase><xref linkend="CreateProfile-Register" xrefstyle="%label &#34;%c&#34;"/>.</para>
      <para>For registering an already installed system, see <phrase xmlns:l="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook/l10n" role="document-xref">Book <quote>Administration Guide</quote>, </phrase><xref linkend="sec-yast-software-register" xrefstyle="%label &#34;%c&#34;"/>.</para>

         <para>If you are installing onto a computer or VM that has access to the Internet, then to install any of the products listed above, it is only necessary to download the <filename>SLE-15-SP7-Online-<replaceable>ARCH</replaceable>-GM-media1.iso</filename> image for the desired architecture.</para>

            <para>The size of the full installation media SLE-15-SP7-Online-<replaceable>ARCH</replaceable>-GM-media1.iso exceeds the capacity of a dual layer DVD. Therefore you can only boot it from a USB flash drive.</para>

         <para>For the installation media and the VM Guest images, SUSE offers two variants:</para>
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>The first, containing <literal>GM</literal> in the file name, consists of the package set as shipped on the first customer shipment date.</para>

            <listitem>
               <para>The second, identified by a <literal>QU</literal> followed by a number in the file name, contains the same package set but includes all maintenance updates of the packages that have been released in the meantime. Quarterly updated media are refreshed every three months, with the first coming three months after the <literal>GM</literal> release.</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
         <para>You only need either the <literal>GM</literal> or the <literal>QU</literal> media, not both. Which version to select depends on your needs and preferences. If you have newer hardware, the QU version might be the better choice. The installation procedure is identical for both variants.</para>
         <para>For both variants it is recommended to install the latest updates released after creation of the images during or immediately after installation.</para>
