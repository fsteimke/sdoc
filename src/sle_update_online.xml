         <para>SUSE offers an intuitive graphical and a simple command-line tool to upgrade a running system to a new service pack. Both provide support for <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs and more. This chapter provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform a service pack upgrade using these tools.</para>

      <para>A service pack migration can be executed by either YaST, <command>zypper</command>, or AutoYaST.</para>
      <para>Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be registered at the SUSE Customer Center or a local RMT server. SUSE Multi-Linux Manager can also be used.</para>

            <para>Reboot the system. From the boot menu, select <guimenu>Start boot loader from a read-only snapshot</guimenu> and then choose the snapshot with the date and number you memorized in the previous step. A second boot menu (the one from the snapshot) is loaded. Select the entry starting with SLES <phrase role="productnumber">15 SP7</phrase> and boot it.</para>

            <para>The system boots into the previous state with the system partition mounted read-only. Log in as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and check whether you have chosen the correct snapshot. Also make sure everything works as expected. Note that since the root file system is mounted read-only, restrictions in functionality may apply.</para>
            <para>In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot and choose a different snapshot to boot from—up to this point no permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:</para>
            <screen><prompt>&gt;</prompt><command>sudo</command> snapper rollback</screen>
            <para>Reboot the machine. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to reboot into the reinstated system.</para>
         </step>
         <step>
            <para>Check if the repository configuration has been properly reset. Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If either one is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time may no longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package repositories.</para>

                  <para>Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories that were added for the update should be listed. For example, if you are rolling back from SLES <phrase role="productnumber">15 SP7</phrase> to SLES15 GA, the list must contain the <literal>SLES15-GA</literal> repositories, and not the <literal>SLES15-SP7</literal> repositories.</para>
                  <para>If wrong repositories are listed, delete them and, if necessary, replace them with the versions matching your product or service pack version. For a list of repositories for the supported migration paths refer to <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-modules"/>. (Note that manual intervention should not be necessary, as the repositories should be updated automatically, but it is a best practice to verify and make any necessary corrections.)</para>

               <step>
                  <para>Last, check the registration status for all products installed by running</para>

                  <para>All products should be reported as being <literal>Registered</literal>. If this is not the case, repair the registration by running</para>
