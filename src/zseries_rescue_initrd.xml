   <title>IBM Z: using initrd as a rescue system</title>
   <info/>
   <para>If the kernel of the SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server for IBM Z is upgraded or modified, it is possible to reboot the system accidentally in an inconsistent state, so standard procedures of IPLing the installed system fail. In such a case, you may use the installation system for rescue purposes.</para>
   <para>IPL the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for IBM Z installation system as described in <phrase xmlns:l="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook/l10n" role="document-xref">Book <quote>Deployment Guide</quote>, </phrase><xref linkend="sec-zseries-prep" xrefstyle="%label &#34;%c&#34;"/>. Choose <guimenu>Start Installation</guimenu> and enter all required parameters. After the installation system has loaded and you are asked which display type to use to control the installation, select <literal>SSH</literal>. Now you can log in to the system with SSH as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> without a password.</para>
   <para>In this state, no disks are configured. You need to configure them before you can proceed.</para>
   <procedure>
      <title>Configuring DASDs</title>
      <step>
         <para>Configure DASDs with the following command:</para>
         <screen>dasd_configure 0.0.0150 1 0</screen>
         <para>0.0.0150 is the channel to which the DASD is connected. The <literal>1</literal> means activate the disk (a <literal>0</literal> at this place would deactivate the disk). The <literal>0</literal> stands for <quote>no DIAG mode</quote> for the disk (a <literal>1</literal> here would enable DAIG access to the disk).</para>
      </step>
      <step>
         <para>Now the DASD is online (check with <command>cat /proc/partitions</command>) and can used for subsequent commands.</para>

      <title>Configuring a zFCP disk</title>
      <step>
         <para>To configure a zFCP disk, it is necessary to first configure the zFCP adapter. Do this with the following command:</para>
         <screen>zfcp_host_configure 0.0.4000 1</screen>
         <para><literal>0.0.4000</literal> is the channel to which the adapter is attached and <literal>1</literal> stands for activate (a <literal>0</literal> here would deactivate the adapter).</para>
      </step>
      <step>
         <para>After the adapter is activated, a disk can be configured. Do this with the following command:</para>
         <screen>zfcp_disk_configure 0.0.4000 1234567887654321 8765432100000000  1</screen>
         <para><literal>0.0.4000</literal> is the previously-used channel ID, <literal>1234567887654321</literal> is the WWPN (World wide Port Number), and <literal>8765432100000000</literal> is the LUN (logical unit number). The <literal>1</literal> stands for activating the disk (a <literal>0</literal> here would deactivate the disk).</para>
      </step>
      <step>
         <para>Now the zFCP disk is online (check with <command>cat /proc/partitions</command>) and can used for subsequent commands.</para>
      </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>Now the rescue system is fully set up and you can start repairing the installed system. See <xref linkend="sec-trouble-data-recover-rescue"/> for instructions on how to repair the most common issues.</para>
